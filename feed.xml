This format is also referred to as AD1 from their extension, and are generated by the popular digital forensics tool; FTK Imager. The research conducted into this file format includes observations made about the overall data structures, ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Exploring IEEE 754 Arithmetic</title><link href="https://tmairi.github.io/posts/exploring-ieee-754-arithmetic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exploring IEEE 754 Arithmetic" /><published>2021-05-10T19:33:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-05-10T20:56:45+01:00</updated> <id>https://tmairi.github.io/posts/exploring-ieee-754-arithmetic/</id> <content src="https://tmairi.github.io/posts/exploring-ieee-754-arithmetic/" /> <author> <name>Mairi</name> </author> <category term="Linux" /> <category term="Mathematics" /> <summary> Foreword This article will be covering the interesting arithmetic involved in the conversion of a hexadecimal value into an IEEE 754 (Floating-Point) value, in the context of computing. Additionally, this article will present a BASH script I wrote to perform such conversions, as well as provide a look into the overall process of developing and testing this script.

A quick look into the hexadecimal output of one of these LNK files showed that there was a lot of valuable information which could be extracted. Therefore, I wen... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Extracting Alternate Data Streams with Linux</title><link href="https://tmairi.github.io/posts/extracting-alternate-data-streams-with-linux/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Extracting Alternate Data Streams with Linux" /><published>2018-06-22T01:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2018-06-22T01:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://tmairi.github.io/posts/extracting-alternate-data-streams-with-linux/</id> <content src="https://tmairi.github.io/posts/extracting-alternate-data-streams-with-linux/" /> <author> <name>Mairi</name> </author> <category term="DFIR" /> <category term="Linux" /> <summary> Foreword This article will be covering a feature of the NTFS file system known as the Alternate Data Stream (ADS), focusing on how to properly identify and extract these data streams from an NTFS volume using a Linux host.
